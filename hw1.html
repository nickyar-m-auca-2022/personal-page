    <p>My name is Meena Nickyar, a young afghan girl with the great desire of higher education from Afghanistan. I have graduated from school in my hometown with flying colors in Ariana Afghan Turk High School. When I was in high school my interest in being a positive and influential part of my society made me start learning the English language from basic level at one of the well known universities in Kabul, Kardan University. I continued my journey of acquiring English language at the Professional Development Institute (PDI) of  American University of Afghanistan. After taking the IELTS preparation course and receiving Certificate and Diploma in English language, I got the opportunity to take a standardized test of English language and got TOEFL (96 scores) which will be counted as one of my accomplishments before starting my academic journey in a university. Also, the Duolingo English test which is one of the most worldwide used English language proficiency tests in the last two years, I have succeeded to pass the test with (125 scores). Aside from following English language classes, the inner curiosity of my mind encouraged me to take some classes related to technology including Networking, CCNA, CompTIA N+, and Ms Windows 10. 
        During my academic life, I have advanced myself with a couple of skills and experiences from national and international Professors and staff in the Professional Development Institute (PDI).  I have been always able from a very young age to manage people and represent their interests and wills as their representative in public. As an active student of this institute I was participating in different social activities including Debate club.   Based on my interest and performing my role as an active member of this club, I participated in different debates among universities located in my hometown. I was awarded as the best speaker in one of the debates based on Women's rights in Kardan University. All these activities resulted in the improvement of my leadership, critical thinking, teamwork and  public speaking skills.
